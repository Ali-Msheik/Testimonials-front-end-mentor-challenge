             “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
           who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
             did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
           project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
           could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
             100% recommend! ” </p>
